# ModernRiftExamples

This repository contains all of the files accessible in the ModernRift Handboook, which will be released soon. 

Until ModernRift is publicly released to NuGet, here are the steps you will need to be able to install it on your system.

- Go to the ModernRift repository, then Releases
- Download the latest release "`.nuget`" file to your desktop
- In your project, add a NuGet source to your desktop
- Switch to that source & refresh the package list

You should see `Rift.ModernRift.Core` as a package (you may have to check "show prereleases"). Install the latest version (even if it's a prerelease).

Now you should be able to import `Rift.ModernRift.Core` in your project.

More details will be provided soon.
