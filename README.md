# ModernRiftExamples

This repository contains all of the files accessible in the [ModernRift Handboook](github.com/RiftEngine/ModernRiftCore/wiki). 

Until ModernRift is publicly released to NuGet, here are the steps you will need to be able to install it on your system.

- Go to the ModernRift repository, then Releases
- Download the latest release "`.nupkg`" file to your desktop
- In your project, add a NuGet source to your desktop
- Switch to that source & refresh the package list

You should see `Rift.ModernRift.Core` as a package (you may have to check "show prereleases"). Install the latest version (even if it's a prerelease).

Now you should be able to import `Rift.ModernRift.Core` in your project.
